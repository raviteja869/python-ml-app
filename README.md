# python-ml-app

Create a complete GitHub Actions workflow for the sample project, focusing on CI/CD implementation to build, test, and deploy the project:
Build the Python project source code and store the build output as a log file. See: Building and testing Python - GitHub Docs
Test your Python project and generate a code coverage report using a Marketplace Action; store the test results as a log file, and the code coverage results
Deploy your Python project as a Docker Container with the build, test and code coverage results as artifacts included in your deployment; you may select any deployment environment that you prefer, e.g. AWS. To ease working with your container and gathering output from a test run of the container, see the following: Docker Container Action · Actions · GitHub Marketplace · GitHub
